# Thirty Sites

## Front End Development Challenge

In Feb. 2018 I joined the #30Days30Sites twitter challenge, to improve my front end skills. Soon I figured out to build each site the way I want, it would take me way longer than one day of work. Therefore, I let go of the deadlines and am focusing on the learning and building experience.

Live Demos of all sites (built so far) can be found here:
