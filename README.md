# Thirty Sites

## Front End Development Challenge

This is my repo for the #30Days30Sites twitter challenge, to improve my front end and design skills. You can see the sites I've built visiting [this landing page](https://mairamartins.com/30sites/index.html).

**Rules**

- I rarely code on weekends and holidays. My free time is sacred. I suspect my 30 days challenge will probably take 90+ to complete :)
- 5 of the sites will use Semantic UI, Mini CSS or other new (to me) frameworks.
- 10 of the sites will use BootStrap.
- The remaining 15 sites will be built with custom styles, Sass/SCSS and CSS grid for the site layout.
